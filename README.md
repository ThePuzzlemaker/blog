# About This Site

## What is this site?

This site is my blog. I'm not using a CMS (i.e. Wordpress, what I used to use) for it anymore, as I honestly find them irritating at times.

## How'd you make it?

I used [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), which is written in Rust, used for documentation and information about many Rust packages. I honestly just like the style and ease of use, hence why I used it.

## Got a question to ask?

Feel free to [email me](mailto:tpzker@thepuzzlemaker.info)! I may leave the question and answer here if it relates to this site.
